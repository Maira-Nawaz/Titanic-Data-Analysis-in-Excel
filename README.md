# Titanic-Data-Analysis-in-Excel


In this project, I explored and analyzed the Titanic dataset using **Microsoft Excel**. My focus was on transforming raw data into meaningful insights using **data cleaning**, **manipulation**, and **pivot table visualizations**. Here's an overview of the steps I followed and the skills I applied:

---

###  1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

* Removed unnecessary columns and corrected column headers.
* Dealt with **missing values** in features like `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin`.
* Created **new columns** for better analysis:

  * Categorized passengers into **age groups** (Child, Teenager, Young Adult, Adult, Senior Citizen).
  * Grouped `Fare` into **Fare Ranges** (Low, Medium, High).
  * Split `Sex` and `Survived` columns to show survival status by gender.
  * Categorized passengers by **family size** based on `SibSp` and `Parch`.

###  2. Pivot Table Creation & Analysis

Used multiple **Pivot Tables** to summarize and analyze cleaned data:

* **Survival Analysis**:

  * Compared the survival rate across different **genders** and **age groups**.
  * Analyzed survival by **passenger class (Pclass)**.

* **Class & Embarkation**:

  * Explored how passenger **class and embarkation port** affected survival.
  * Found class-based survival trends within each port (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton).

* **Age Group Analysis**:

  * Identified which age groups had higher survival rates.
  * Compared **not survived vs survived** within each age group and class.

* **Family Size Analysis**:

  * Assessed how having family aboard impacted survival chances.
  * Used family size as a category (1, 2, 3... members).

* **Fare Range Analysis**:

  * Evaluated the impact of ticket fare on survival likelihood.
  * Grouped fare into `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.

###  Key Excel Features Used:

* Pivot Tables
* Custom Grouping & Categorization
* Percentage Calculation
* Sorting & Filtering
* Data Cleaning Techniques

###  Insights Gained:

* **Females** had a much higher survival rate than males.
* **First-class passengers** had the highest chance of survival.
* **Children and teenagers** had better survival chances compared to adults.
* Most passengers who paid **high fares** survived.
* Survival rates varied significantly by **embarkation port**.
